Remember to submit your news to the #FRUP you can do it either one of two ways. First, for convenience, you can simply send a tweet and add the hashtag #FRUP to the tweet. Just make sure that when you do this, that the tweet shows up if the hashtag &ldquo;#FRUP&rdquo; is being searched for. Twitter has a habit of not always including every tweet for a given hashtag, and we want to make sure we cover all the news we can.

My hope is that we will get a chance to introduce you to more of them over the coming months. This interview is with Erik Reagan of <a href="http://focuslabllc.com/">Focus Lab, LLC.</a> I chose Erik to go first as Focus Lab is launching their new website today as well. So after you finish reading this interview make sure to head on over to the new <a href="http://focuslabllc.com/">Focus Lab website</a> and see the beautiful changes that Erik and the rest of the Focus Lab team have worked hard on.</p>

<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know Erik you should know that he is a patient family man that is more than willing to help out another dev on a problem. He regularly assists people on twitter and is an active member in the weekly chats. He also teaches a class for other devs to learn how to build add-ons for EE. In general, he is a pretty awesome dude and we are glad he is part of our community. So let&#8217;s learn a bit more about Erik&#8230;</p>

<center><img src="http://expressionengine.com/files/blog/erik_reagan_1.jpg" alt="Erik Reagan hard at work" width="500" alt="desc" /></center>

<p><br />
<strong>Can you tell us a little about Erik? If you were to write a bio for your about page what would be important for the reader to know?</strong></p>

<p>That depends. How long is my about page? I do know that I wouldn&#8217;t bore people with industry-based info about me.</p>

<p>I would start off by bragging about my family. My wife and daughter are pretty much the coolest gals around. Without their support there would be no Erik on Twitter or in the EE forums. I love them with all of my heart and really enjoy having the opportunity to provide for them.</p>

<p>In high school my plan was to be a rockstar and/or studio engineer and producer for a living. After high school I went to school to be a music educator. Music has a huge impact in my family and I can&#8217;t imagine that changing anytime soon. If you haven&#8217;t noticed though, I changed my mind on the rockstar status.</p>

<p>A few years ago I realized I wanted to run my own show. Make my own hours. Build a business worth investing in. My ultimate business goal is to have a company that does rock-solid work and enables employees to love their work, but more importantly love and enjoy their life.</p>

<p><strong>Funny, music seems to be a common theme in the web design community. What did you study? Do you play additional instruments?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that music is a common theme in the design community as well. I joked (partially) a while back that there should be an EE band at the next EECI.</p>

<p>Specifically, I studied Music Education (BME) with a focus on (or &#8220;primary instrument&#8221; of) Voice. I basically sang for grades. Both of my parents are former music teachers, my grandmother is a piano teacher (she&#8217;s pretty much amazing), my father plays classical guitar, and the list goes on. I started taking piano lessons at a pretty young age, but haven&#8217;t practiced in over a decade. I can still play to a degree, but I couldn&#8217;t just hop on a stage and jam at this point. My main instruments are guitar and voice now-a-days.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t let me mislead you though - I studied music, but didn&#8217;t graduate with a degree in music. After studying music the way the professors told me to I decided I didn&#8217;t want to do that for a living. I changed my major to Computer Science after completing two semesters for my BME. That being said, I never even took a CS class. I had other things going on (like meeting my wonderful bride) that made me realize I didn&#8217;t even want to be in school at that time. So I guess I&#8217;m technically a college dropout.</p>

<p><strong>Along those same lines, what are your musical tastes? Do you have some music that is your &#8220;go to&#8221; for coding marathons?</strong><br />
My taste is pretty eclectic. As I type this I&#8217;m listening to Ahmad Jamal Trio (Jazz, for those unaware). The morning emails started off with Needtobreathe as my soundtrack. I do have a playlist called &#8220;Now This I Can Work To&#8221; but even it isn&#8217;t limited to a particular genre. Some artists in the list are Waterdeep, John Mayer, Glad, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Jake Shimabukuro, 2Cellos &amp; The Roots.</p>

<p>When it comes to &#8220;coding marathons&#8221; I have a pretty refined subset of songs I listen to. They have to meet a specific criteria. They need to be pretty upbeat (if not rhythmically, then energetically). They can&#8217;t be too musically intriguing (or I&#8217;ll just want to stop and listen) and they can&#8217;t make me want to pick up an instrument. That might sound strange, but it makes for the most efficient coding sessions for me.</p>

<p><strong>So how did you get your start in the World Wide Web?</strong></p>

<p>When I was in 6th grade my dad was my computer teacher. In his class (and outside) he encouraged me to learn HTML (3.2 at the time). I dabbled in HTML and Javascript here and there for a few years. Somewhere along the way I started using FrontPage 98. I built my first paid website with that. It was pretty horrible, but I didn&#8217;t know any different.</p>

<p>Later in high school I went into some server-side languages and Flash. I really liked Flash for a while and was coming up with random projects for it. I spent many hours in the flashkit.com forums (as a member and also a moderator) learning more than I needed to know about Flash and Actionscript. I later saw the light and put my Flash days behind me <img src="http://ellislab.com/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /></p>

<p><strong>I know you are a visual individual as we&#8217;ve spoken about your love of photography before. I find it interesting that you moved into code versus design. When you think back was there anything in particular that moved you in that direction?</strong></p>

<p>I left out the design history because frankly, it stunk. I know my way around Photoshop pretty well. I&#8217;m not too bad with a pencil and a piece of paper either. What I&#8217;m not good at is coming up with something on a blank canvas. I can&#8217;t create something new, or from my imagination even. Not anything pretty that is. However, if I can look at and review the lines, shapes and depth of something I&#8217;m not too bad a reproducing it.</p>

<p>I like reproducing things but it&#8217;s ultimately not fulfilling.</p>

<p>When it comes to code I had a knack for seeing a problem and creating a solution. I didn&#8217;t need a diagram or outline to make it happen (not all of the time at least). Because of this I drifted more toward the code rather than the design. You mentioned photography. It&#8217;s actually a similar story. My wife takes 90% of the photos in our family because she has an eye for it. I just answer the occasional technical question about ratios, depths and lighting angles.</p>

<p><strong>So, now you find yourself part of a successful design studio. Can you tell me a little about how Focus Lab came about? And what your role there entails?</strong></p>

<p>Focus Lab has existed for about 4 years. My business partner, Bill Kenney, and I met when I saw an ad for a Flash developer needed for a contract job. I met with Bill and our personalities instantly clicked. We were both doing freelance work as a part-time job. We talked over some details and decided to just partner up and combine clients and efforts. By April of 2010 we both had switched over to running our business full-time. At that point we renamed our business to Focus Lab, LLC and defined some clearer goals for the company. The rest, as they say, is history. Except for the future that is. That&#8217;s not history. We need to make it first.</p>

<p>My role at Focus Lab (at this point at least) is hard to nail down ultimately. Being a small company we owners wear more hats than one. I suppose the most relevant one is that I&#8217;m the lead developer. I make sure that the development that goes out of our doors is solid and sharp. I also lead the EE training and consulting that we do. Ultimately I&#8217;d like to hand over the reins on the development and focus more (see what I did there?) on business development.</p>

<p><strong>Is that before or after you quit your day job to be a comedian? In all seriousness though, Focus Lab is doing some amazing work. Can you give us an idea of what your process is for new clients?</strong></p>

<p>Wow, thanks!</p>

<p>For any project we start by asking clients to explain (or we help identify) the problem they are trying to solve. From there we work through possible solutions based on the timeframe and budget. The idea is simply that in the end they have a product that we and they are proud to showcase. There is a variety of unicorns, black magic and Monty Python references in between those steps, but that&#8217;s mostly how it goes.</p>

<p><strong>So switching gears a little, how long have you been using EE? And you are now part of the Reactor Team for ExpressionEngine. How has that experience been?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using EE for about 3 or 4 years. It started at my then day job when I was looking for a solution that allowed me to manage content for multiple sites across multiple domains but sharing content and members. As you can imagine, EE&#8217;s MSM fit the mold quite well.</p>

<p>My first look at EE turned me off instantly. I didn&#8217;t get it therefore I didn&#8217;t like it. However, after going through Train-ee&#8217;s tutorials and watching some helpful screencasts I had the &#8220;ah-ha&#8221; moment I was needing. I haven&#8217;t looked back since.</p>

<p>Being part of Reactor is really fun. I&#8217;m having conversations I may have not otherwise had. Most of my participation thus far has been centered around ideas and planning so the first EE release with Reactor contributions won&#8217;t have anything from me. I have some goodies in the works though. I&#8217;m really excited about the experiment as a whole and I&#8217;m thrilled to be a part of it.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like to do to recharge in your off time? Any hobbies or activities that you enjoy?</strong></p>

<p>Time with my beautiful wife and daughter is certainly at the top of that list. They inspire, motivate and encourage me in so many ways. I love the time I have with them and am very grateful for having them in my life.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p><center><img src="http://expressionengine.com/files/blog/erik_reagan_2.jpg" alt="Erik's Motivation" width="500" alt="desc" /></center>

<p><br />
In terms of hobbies, I mainly have three right now. I love music (as mentioned earlier) so picking up the guitar is always an instant sense of peace for me. I also love billiards. I wish I had more time to play but I still get to a table a few times a month. Lastly, as of late I&#8217;ve picked up running. It&#8217;s way more enjoyable than I would have imagined. It gives me some time to not think about much of anything.</p>

<p><strong>Erik, I want to thank you for your time. Before we go is there anything else you want to share?</strong></p>

<p>Sure! If anyone out there ever wants to chat with me about anything I have an open inbox. From development and business to family and faith. I love having a good conversation and learning with others.</p>

<p>Also, I&#8217;ll insert the obligatory shameless plug. Keep an eye on Focus Lab this year. We have a lot of exciting things on the horizon!</p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Tue, 24 Jan 2012 20:42:18 GMT";s:7:"summary";s:11650:"<p>Today I am proud to push submit on a blog post highlighting one of our Reactor Team members. My hope is that we will get a chance to introduce you to more of them over the coming months. This interview is with Erik Reagan of <a href="http://focuslabllc.com/">Focus Lab, LLC.</a> I chose Erik to go first as Focus Lab is launching their new website today as well. So after you finish reading this interview make sure to head on over to the new <a href="http://focuslabllc.com/">Focus Lab website</a> and see the beautiful changes that Erik and the rest of the Focus Lab team have worked hard on.</p>

<p>For those of you that don&#8217;t know Erik you should know that he is a patient family man that is more than willing to help out another dev on a problem. He regularly assists people on twitter and is an active member in the weekly chats. He also teaches a class for other devs to learn how to build add-ons for EE. In general, he is a pretty awesome dude and we are glad he is part of our community. So let&#8217;s learn a bit more about Erik&#8230;</p>

<center><img src="http://expressionengine.com/files/blog/erik_reagan_1.jpg" alt="Erik Reagan hard at work" width="500" alt="desc" /></center>

<p><br />
<strong>Can you tell us a little about Erik? If you were to write a bio for your about page what would be important for the reader to know?</strong></p>

<p>That depends. How long is my about page? I do know that I wouldn&#8217;t bore people with industry-based info about me.</p>

<p>I would start off by bragging about my family. My wife and daughter are pretty much the coolest gals around. Without their support there would be no Erik on Twitter or in the EE forums. I love them with all of my heart and really enjoy having the opportunity to provide for them.</p>

<p>In high school my plan was to be a rockstar and/or studio engineer and producer for a living. After high school I went to school to be a music educator. Music has a huge impact in my family and I can&#8217;t imagine that changing anytime soon. If you haven&#8217;t noticed though, I changed my mind on the rockstar status.</p>

<p>A few years ago I realized I wanted to run my own show. Make my own hours. Build a business worth investing in. My ultimate business goal is to have a company that does rock-solid work and enables employees to love their work, but more importantly love and enjoy their life.</p>

<p><strong>Funny, music seems to be a common theme in the web design community. What did you study? Do you play additional instruments?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that music is a common theme in the design community as well. I joked (partially) a while back that there should be an EE band at the next EECI.</p>

<p>Specifically, I studied Music Education (BME) with a focus on (or &#8220;primary instrument&#8221; of) Voice. I basically sang for grades. Both of my parents are former music teachers, my grandmother is a piano teacher (she&#8217;s pretty much amazing), my father plays classical guitar, and the list goes on. I started taking piano lessons at a pretty young age, but haven&#8217;t practiced in over a decade. I can still play to a degree, but I couldn&#8217;t just hop on a stage and jam at this point. My main instruments are guitar and voice now-a-days.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t let me mislead you though - I studied music, but didn&#8217;t graduate with a degree in music. After studying music the way the professors told me to I decided I didn&#8217;t want to do that for a living. I changed my major to Computer Science after completing two semesters for my BME. That being said, I never even took a CS class. I had other things going on (like meeting my wonderful bride) that made me realize I didn&#8217;t even want to be in school at that time. So I guess I&#8217;m technically a college dropout.</p>

<p><strong>Along those same lines, what are your musical tastes? Do you have some music that is your &#8220;go to&#8221; for coding marathons?</strong><br />
My taste is pretty eclectic. As I type this I&#8217;m listening to Ahmad Jamal Trio (Jazz, for those unaware). The morning emails started off with Needtobreathe as my soundtrack. I do have a playlist called &#8220;Now This I Can Work To&#8221; but even it isn&#8217;t limited to a particular genre. Some artists in the list are Waterdeep, John Mayer, Glad, Andrew Lloyd Webber, Jake Shimabukuro, 2Cellos &amp; The Roots.</p>

<p>When it comes to &#8220;coding marathons&#8221; I have a pretty refined subset of songs I listen to. They have to meet a specific criteria. They need to be pretty upbeat (if not rhythmically, then energetically). They can&#8217;t be too musically intriguing (or I&#8217;ll just want to stop and listen) and they can&#8217;t make me want to pick up an instrument. That might sound strange, but it makes for the most efficient coding sessions for me.</p>

<p><strong>So how did you get your start in the World Wide Web?</strong></p>

<p>When I was in 6th grade my dad was my computer teacher. In his class (and outside) he encouraged me to learn HTML (3.2 at the time). I dabbled in HTML and Javascript here and there for a few years. Somewhere along the way I started using FrontPage 98. I built my first paid website with that. It was pretty horrible, but I didn&#8217;t know any different.</p>

<p>Later in high school I went into some server-side languages and Flash. I really liked Flash for a while and was coming up with random projects for it. I spent many hours in the flashkit.com forums (as a member and also a moderator) learning more than I needed to know about Flash and Actionscript. I later saw the light and put my Flash days behind me <img src="http://ellislab.com/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /></p>

<p><strong>I know you are a visual individual as we&#8217;ve spoken about your love of photography before. I find it interesting that you moved into code versus design. When you think back was there anything in particular that moved you in that direction?</strong></p>

<p>I left out the design history because frankly, it stunk. I know my way around Photoshop pretty well. I&#8217;m not too bad with a pencil and a piece of paper either. What I&#8217;m not good at is coming up with something on a blank canvas. I can&#8217;t create something new, or from my imagination even. Not anything pretty that is. However, if I can look at and review the lines, shapes and depth of something I&#8217;m not too bad a reproducing it.</p>

<p>I like reproducing things but it&#8217;s ultimately not fulfilling.</p>

<p>When it comes to code I had a knack for seeing a problem and creating a solution. I didn&#8217;t need a diagram or outline to make it happen (not all of the time at least). Because of this I drifted more toward the code rather than the design. You mentioned photography. It&#8217;s actually a similar story. My wife takes 90% of the photos in our family because she has an eye for it. I just answer the occasional technical question about ratios, depths and lighting angles.</p>

<p><strong>So, now you find yourself part of a successful design studio. Can you tell me a little about how Focus Lab came about? And what your role there entails?</strong></p>

<p>Focus Lab has existed for about 4 years. My business partner, Bill Kenney, and I met when I saw an ad for a Flash developer needed for a contract job. I met with Bill and our personalities instantly clicked. We were both doing freelance work as a part-time job. We talked over some details and decided to just partner up and combine clients and efforts. By April of 2010 we both had switched over to running our business full-time. At that point we renamed our business to Focus Lab, LLC and defined some clearer goals for the company. The rest, as they say, is history. Except for the future that is. That&#8217;s not history. We need to make it first.</p>

<p>My role at Focus Lab (at this point at least) is hard to nail down ultimately. Being a small company we owners wear more hats than one. I suppose the most relevant one is that I&#8217;m the lead developer. I make sure that the development that goes out of our doors is solid and sharp. I also lead the EE training and consulting that we do. Ultimately I&#8217;d like to hand over the reins on the development and focus more (see what I did there?) on business development.</p>

<p><strong>Is that before or after you quit your day job to be a comedian? In all seriousness though, Focus Lab is doing some amazing work. Can you give us an idea of what your process is for new clients?</strong></p>

<p>Wow, thanks!</p>

The idea is simply that in the end they have a product that we and they are proud to showcase. There is a variety of unicorns, black magic and Monty Python references in between those steps, but that&#8217;s mostly how it goes.</p>

We see these threads occasionally, and we encourage them. We learn quite a bit about the communities&#8217; desires from them. But in <a href="http://expressionengine.com/forums/viewreply/933794/">this particular one</a>, Mike Hughes stated the following:</p>

<blockquote><p>One thing I feel EllisLab and EE would benefit from is having a Product Evangelist. Everyone knows that anyone that has used EE swears up and down by it (for the most part) but that’s not necessarily the Product Evangelist I’m talking about.&nbsp; EL needs someone who’s sole purpose is to get out and talk to large organizations and explain the benefits of the platform straight from the horses mouth so we, as developers, aren’t facing a total uphill battle as Paul Burton described of having a great solution that has zero penetration in the minds of the decision makers.&nbsp; Obviously there would need to be a strategy in place to make sure this person (these people) attend the right conferences and meet with the right people but I really believe this would help.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Something resonated in my mind as I read this. Years ago I was speaking at an IBM conference, and one of the IBM guys got up to talk to the speakers. His title was Product Evangelist. I remember distinctly thinking that one day I wanted to have that title. It fits with my work experience perfectly. For those of you that are unfamiliar with the Product Evangelist role, it is a cross between an educator and a business development role. It is a position that usually means the person filling it is just crazy in love with the product that they are representing. Guy Kawasaki <a href="http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_art_of_evan.html">wrote a blog post awhile back</a> describing it as:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Evangelist&#8221; isn&#8217;t simply a job title. It&#8217;s a way of life. It means that the evangelist totally loves the product and sees it as a way to bring the &#8220;good news.&#8221; A love of the cause is the second most important determinant of the success of an evangelist&#8212;second only to the quality of the cause itself. No matter how great the person, if he doesn&#8217;t love the cause, he cannot be a good evangelist for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we have made the decision to make some changes to the organization at EllisLab. Effective immediately, I will be the Product Evangelist / Director of Business Development. As such my goal will be to proselytize the good news of the EllisLab products. I will be responsible for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>helping the community sell more ExpressionEngine projects. Need someone to talk to a prospect to alleviate some obstacles they have with using EE? I&#8217;m your guy. Unsure of how to present EE in a sales situation? Let&#8217;s talk.</li>
	<li>giving demos and talking to people about how ExpressionEngine might fit their project.</li>
	<li>funneling people to the awesome community of add-on developers when helping them think through how to approach a project. So if you are an add-on developer, make sure I know about the products you are bringing to the community. I regularly talk about and show add-ons when giving demos.</li>
	<li>continue in the role of making sure our website has new content that promotes developers and designers in our community. This covers the Pro Network, Showcase and Blog. So if you are doing something cool with EE, let me know.</li>
	<li>speaking with designers and developers outside of our community in an effort to expand the Web Design community&#8217;s knowledge of EE</li>
	<li>speaking with business people about the benefits of using EE over other Enterprise or Open Source systems</li>
	<li>advocate on behalf of the community internally for certain features to be added to the core. Do you have a favorite feature? Make your case with me.</li>
	<li>speaking at and encouraging others in our community to speak at conferences</li>
	<li>attending conferences to take part in the web design communities&#8217; conversation</li>
	<li>help with the overall marketing strategy for EllisLab</li>
</ul>

<p>As I now move into this new role, our own Kevin Smith has been tapped to become our new Director of Services. Kevin has been a champion for our customers in the support forums and an agent of innovation within EllisLab. He brings with him a fresh vision of support for ExpressionEngine and MojoMotor, and we&#8217;re excited about the new services you&#8217;ll be able to take advantage of over the next year. Keep your eyes on this blog for announcements in the coming months.</p>

<p>I am encouraged by what I see for our community in 2012 and I hope you are too. If there is anything you can think of that you feel will be of benefit don&#8217;t hesitate to email me. I think you can see by this role change that we are inclined to listen <img src="http://ellislab.com/images/smileys/wink.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="wink" style="border:0;" /></p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Thu, 15 Dec 2011 14:07:53 GMT";s:7:"summary";s:5047:"<p>This past summer there was a thread in the forums titled <i>The State of EE</i>.

<p><strong>When you look back at 2011 and the strides that have been made in Web Design what blows you away?</strong></p>

<p>I think we measure the advancement of web design not with trends or tools, but in the bigger more holistic ways we design and build. Most evident to me is how we&#8217;re maturing fast, and how much we care as a community about the work we create, and the audiences we&#8217;re trying to reach. We&#8217;ve moved up yet another level, crafting thoughtful experiences, coming to terms with the ebb and flow of the web and it&#8217;s unique properties. We&#8217;ve started defining our own vocabulary with elegant terms and techniques such as Responsive Web Design.</p>

<p>RWD is perhaps the most explored technique of the last year or so. By default, the browser is a responsive tool, and you could argue that we&#8217;ve always been responsive in our approaches. Then again, we embraced the fixed-width layout when in actual fact we can achieve so much more by implementing flexible layouts that really make sense of the web environment. I love the innovative uses of RWD, and how people take that, and push it even further. I also love how we&#8217;ve begun to care about storytelling on the web, and how we can use clever parallax scrolling, movement, typography, and narratives to deliver beautiful, wholly engaging and surprising experiences. We&#8217;re getting to grips with the unique visual language of the web, and that&#8217;s affording big opportunities for those prepared to take risks and try stuff.</p><center><a href="http://natecroft.com/" title="Mr Simon Collision - Photo by Nate Croft"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5251/5402583081_3b127f143e_z.jpg" width="480" alt="Mr Simon Collision - Photo by Nate Croft" style="margin-bottom:15px;"></a></center>

<p><br />
<strong>You made a huge change when you started New Adventures in Web Design. What made you move in that direction after becoming a highly successful creative/web designer? </strong></p>

<p>I left Erskine at the start of 2010 because I needed a change, and wanted to learn new things, take risks, and see what happened. I didn&#8217;t want to become a businessman, but that was happening, and I felt suffocated. I also wasn&#8217;t a very good leader to be honest. I fell in to some incredible projects, and good work is still the backbone.</p>

<p>One outcome of leaving was being asked to do a lot more speaking at events. Through that, I saw a lot of events, some that inspired and moved the web forward, and some that were in decline, or just plain useless. I knew I could do it, and what I would improve if I had the chance.</p>

<p>Throughout 2010 I spent time with lots of really intelligent designers and we were talking about the maturing web industry, and what we can each do to move it forward. After the excellent EECI San Francisco, I came home and decided I wanted to do my bit to facilitate this ongoing design dialogue. It was a scary thought to organise a huge conference, but I sort of did it without thinking. Nottingham is underserved by such events, yet it&#8217;s surrounded by many populous cities chock-full of practitioners who really care - a ready audience. Even so, attendees come from all over the world. There were problems and unexpected hurdles, but the generosity of everyone involved made it a huge success. Every attendee, sponsor and speaker wanted it to work out, so they all went above and beyond. I&#8217;m very grateful for that, and it&#8217;s indicative of the positive nature of the web industry I think.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s only a part of what I do, and it&#8217;s much easier to organise the second time around. Expectations go up, costs increase, but much of the logistics are now proven, flexible. I also have Greg Wood working with me on the event which helps a great deal. It&#8217;s actually a huge amount of fun to pull it all together.</p>

<p><strong>If you were to talk to that new person that just got his first HTML/CSS book. What would you tell them? What advice would you give him to help them?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d remind them that learning HTML and CSS is a key skill, but not to get too hung up on that. They are tools, the scaffold for our ideas. We need HTML and CSS to bring our ideas to fruition, but the bigger goal is to create meaningful work, to design ideas and communicate to the appropriate audiences. Don&#8217;t lean on the tools. Get to know them, care about them, be a craftsman and push these languages, but remember the most important thing: we have a responsibility to communicate to audiences effectively, to inspire, surprise, and delight. These things are really important.</p>

<p><strong>If you were to talk to that new person that just got his first copy of Photoshop/Fireworks. What would you tell them? What advice would you give him to help them?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d tell them to get the fastest Mac possible if they intend to do anything with Photoshop. If you spend all day pushing it to the max like I often do, it&#8217;s all about processor power. I&#8217;d make sure they were up to speed with masks and layer techniques, that they knew all the best shortcuts, that they can manipulate opacities, transforms, and that they have the appropriate colour setup. Photoshop is definitely brilliant and powerful, but not the greatest web design tool. Again, Photoshop and Fireworks are just tools. If they don&#8217;t work for you, try something else. At the very least, don&#8217;t let the limitations of these applications get in the way of your bigger ideas. Remember to design real living behavioural and navigable experiences in the browser when relevant, or prototype with paper. Keep your process mixed up and flexible.</p>

<p><strong>So you&#8217;ve had quite the career thus far. Started a design studio, become a highly sought after speaker, organized a conference, written books, designed, coded etc (add to this if I have missed anything). Do you prefer one over the other? Or does doing all of these things satisfy some internal craving to always be doing something different?</strong></p>

<p>I can&#8217;t settle. Never could. I&#8217;ve always moved on when I got too comfortable or needed to change things. I&#8217;m not afraid to take gambles to shake things up and create new opportunities and directions. The risks are high, but I work hard and explore relationships so that exciting things tend to keep coming my way.</p>

<p>Since returning to freelance in early 2010, I&#8217;ve focused on front-end design, and rarely worry about the back-end. I collaborate with smart people on most projects, so others with specific skills can fill in the blanks. I tend to do a lot more writing these days as I have a lot going on in my brain. I&#8217;ve also been traveling the world doing presentations and workshops, which I find incredibly rewarding. These things are great opportunities to meet people, share ideas, and keep learning from others. For the same reasons, I started the New Adventures events, to encourage the design dialogue, get people together to share and learn. It feels good to be facilitating something meaningful like that.</p>

<p>I think speaking and writing are key for me as they force me to draw conclusions around my lines of inquiry; to boil stuff down so that I can share my findings or ideas with audiences. Of course, you can only do this for so long before you lose touch, so I&#8217;m planning to step back a bit in 2012 and focus on projects and keep learning. I can then write and speak more about new things in a year or so. That&#8217;s the plan.</p>

<p><strong>You go by the moniker Colly. I&#8217;ve always wanted to know if you have ever owned a Collie? <img src="http://ellislab.com/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /></strong></p>

<p>Ha! No. Collies are very intelligent, lively, demanding animals in need of big open spaces and sheep to chase. Alas, I don&#8217;t have the time to entertain a lively dog, nor do I have fields of sheep. Dogs are out of the question as I travel for maybe half of the year. So, for now it&#8217;s Bearface (the cat), and no dogs. One day, I swear I will have a Collie.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for your time Simon. I really appreciate it.</strong></p>";s:7:"pubdate";s:29:"Tue, 06 Dec 2011 18:20:16 GMT";s:7:"summary";s:8951:"<p>Our community is rich with designers and developers that change the online world.

<p>I think we measure the advancement of web design not with trends or tools, but in the bigger more holistic ways we design and build. Most evident to me is how we&#8217;re maturing fast, and how much we care as a community about the work we create, and the audiences we&#8217;re trying to reach. We&#8217;ve moved up yet another level, crafting thoughtful experiences, coming to terms with the ebb and flow of the web and it&#8217;s unique properties. We&#8217;ve started defining our own vocabulary with elegant terms and techniques such as Responsive Web Design.</p>

<p>RWD is perhaps the most explored technique of the last year or so. By default, the browser is a responsive tool, and you could argue that we&#8217;ve always been responsive in our approaches. Then again, we embraced the fixed-width layout when in actual fact we can achieve so much more by implementing flexible layouts that really make sense of the web environment. I love the innovative uses of RWD, and how people take that, and push it even further. I also love how we&#8217;ve begun to care about storytelling on the web, and how we can use clever parallax scrolling, movement, typography, and narratives to deliver beautiful, wholly engaging and surprising experiences. We&#8217;re getting to grips with the unique visual language of the web, and that&#8217;s affording big opportunities for those prepared to take risks and try stuff.</p><center><a href="http://natecroft.com/" title="Mr Simon Collision - Photo by Nate Croft"><img src="http://farm6.staticflickr.com/5251/5402583081_3b127f143e_z.jpg" width="480" alt="Mr Simon Collision - Photo by Nate Croft" style="margin-bottom:15px;"></a></center>

<p><br />
<strong>You made a huge change when you started New Adventures in Web Design. What made you move in that direction after becoming a highly successful creative/web designer? </strong></p>

<p>I left Erskine at the start of 2010 because I needed a change, and wanted to learn new things, take risks, and see what happened. I didn&#8217;t want to become a businessman, but that was happening, and I felt suffocated. I also wasn&#8217;t a very good leader to be honest. I fell in to some incredible projects, and good work is still the backbone.</p>

<p>One outcome of leaving was being asked to do a lot more speaking at events. Through that, I saw a lot of events, some that inspired and moved the web forward, and some that were in decline, or just plain useless. I knew I could do it, and what I would improve if I had the chance.</p>

<p>Throughout 2010 I spent time with lots of really intelligent designers and we were talking about the maturing web industry, and what we can each do to move it forward. After the excellent EECI San Francisco, I came home and decided I wanted to do my bit to facilitate this ongoing design dialogue. It was a scary thought to organise a huge conference, but I sort of did it without thinking. Nottingham is underserved by such events, yet it&#8217;s surrounded by many populous cities chock-full of practitioners who really care - a ready audience. Even so, attendees come from all over the world. There were problems and unexpected hurdles, but the generosity of everyone involved made it a huge success. Every attendee, sponsor and speaker wanted it to work out, so they all went above and beyond. I&#8217;m very grateful for that, and it&#8217;s indicative of the positive nature of the web industry I think.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it&#8217;s only a part of what I do, and it&#8217;s much easier to organise the second time around. Expectations go up, costs increase, but much of the logistics are now proven, flexible. I also have Greg Wood working with me on the event which helps a great deal. It&#8217;s actually a huge amount of fun to pull it all together.</p>

<p><strong>If you were to talk to that new person that just got his first HTML/CSS book. What would you tell them? What advice would you give him to help them?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d remind them that learning HTML and CSS is a key skill, but not to get too hung up on that. They are tools, the scaffold for our ideas. We need HTML and CSS to bring our ideas to fruition, but the bigger goal is to create meaningful work, to design ideas and communicate to the appropriate audiences. Don&#8217;t lean on the tools. Get to know them, care about them, be a craftsman and push these languages, but remember the most important thing: we have a responsibility to communicate to audiences effectively, to inspire, surprise, and delight. These things are really important.</p>

<p><strong>If you were to talk to that new person that just got his first copy of Photoshop/Fireworks. What would you tell them? What advice would you give him to help them?</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;d tell them to get the fastest Mac possible if they intend to do anything with Photoshop. If you spend all day pushing it to the max like I often do, it&#8217;s all about processor power. I&#8217;d make sure they were up to speed with masks and layer techniques, that they knew all the best shortcuts, that they can manipulate opacities, transforms, and that they have the appropriate colour setup. Photoshop is definitely brilliant and powerful, but not the greatest web design tool. Again, Photoshop and Fireworks are just tools. If they don&#8217;t work for you, try something else. At the very least, don&#8217;t let the limitations of these applications get in the way of your bigger ideas. Remember to design real living behavioural and navigable experiences in the browser when relevant, or prototype with paper. Keep your process mixed up and flexible.</p>

<p><strong>So you&#8217;ve had quite the career thus far. Started a design studio, become a highly sought after speaker, organized a conference, written books, designed, coded etc (add to this if I have missed anything). Do you prefer one over the other? Or does doing all of these things satisfy some internal craving to always be doing something different?</strong></p>

<p>I can&#8217;t settle. Never could. I&#8217;ve always moved on when I got too comfortable or needed to change things. I&#8217;m not afraid to take gambles to shake things up and create new opportunities and directions. The risks are high, but I work hard and explore relationships so that exciting things tend to keep coming my way.</p>

<p>Since returning to freelance in early 2010, I&#8217;ve focused on front-end design, and rarely worry about the back-end. I collaborate with smart people on most projects, so others with specific skills can fill in the blanks. I tend to do a lot more writing these days as I have a lot going on in my brain. I&#8217;ve also been traveling the world doing presentations and workshops, which I find incredibly rewarding. These things are great opportunities to meet people, share ideas, and keep learning from others. For the same reasons, I started the New Adventures events, to encourage the design dialogue, get people together to share and learn. It feels good to be facilitating something meaningful like that.</p>

<p>I think speaking and writing are key for me as they force me to draw conclusions around my lines of inquiry; to boil stuff down so that I can share my findings or ideas with audiences. Of course, you can only do this for so long before you lose touch, so I&#8217;m planning to step back a bit in 2012 and focus on projects and keep learning. I can then write and speak more about new things in a year or so. That&#8217;s the plan.</p>

<p><strong>You go by the moniker Colly. I&#8217;ve always wanted to know if you have ever owned a Collie? <img src="http://ellislab.com/images/smileys/smile.gif" width="19" height="19" alt="smile" style="border:0;" /></strong></p>

<p>Ha! No. Collies are very intelligent, lively, demanding animals in need of big open spaces and sheep to chase. Alas, I don&#8217;t have the time to entertain a lively dog, nor do I have fields of sheep. Dogs are out of the question as I travel for maybe half of the year. So, for now it&#8217;s Bearface (the cat), and no dogs. One day, I swear I will have a Collie.</p>

<p><strong>Thanks for your time Simon. I really appreciate it.</strong></p>";}i:11;a:9:{s:5:"title";s:33:"Double #FRUP.

<p>EE Reactor got its start from <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/stinhambo/status/98892086438408192">a tweet by longtime Communty member @stinhambo</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>@EllisLab I&#8217;ll call for an #eecms Reactor group again… There are plenty of devs hungry to contribute to the core.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was skeptical that people would want to contribute to a commercial product in a similar fashion to an open source project, but after encouragement from the #eecms Community (@mediagirl in particular) I put out a feeler on Twitter and immediately received responses from developers wanting to participate. Professionally speaking, it is hard for me to remember a time I was more thankful about being wrong.</p>
<p>I took the idea to the EE dev team, we hashed out a plan, and started interviewing people to be the first team to try this grand experiment.</p>
<p>I discovered that people contribute to projects for three basic reasons. First, because they love the project. Second, because they benefit directly by such contributions. And thirdly, because they geniunely want to help others succeed.</p>
<p>All six members of EE Reactor have a long history of doing incredible work in our community, making a living from their work, and helping others succeed. We&#8217;re humbled that they want to do this directly for ExpressionEngine.</p>
<p>In this way, EE Reactor is no different than any open source project. People contribute to Open Source because they love it, it helps make them successful, and they want others to succeed. The primary difference is that the owners of open source projects make their living from services (more or less) and EllisLab makes its living from product sales.</p>
<p>Is that one difference a deal killer for this type of contribution? That&#8217;s what the EE Reactor experiment is going to find out. We&#8217;re going to keep the team at six members until we have a release or two out there and can evaluate whether it is working or not. If it works, we&#8217;ll look at how we can responsibly expand the program to the list of developers interested in contributing.</p>
<p>Though the EE Reactor team can contribute to any area of EE, we&#8217;ve all agreed that we&#8217;re going to start with Reactor focusing on code that makes life better for the the EE dev community. &#8220;For Developers by Developers&#8221; describes the initial approach perfectly. This is an area that the EE Reactor team knows intimately and there is a clear path they can dig into that fits perfectly with EllisLab&#8217;s dev team&#8217;s plans for EE.</p>
<p>As of the time of publication, the EE Reactor Team has nine confirmed contributions scheduled for release in EE 2.4 (late January). If you want an inside look at some of those contributions along with other items slated for EE 2.4, <a href="http://ellislab.com/connect">subscribe to the EllisLab Newsletter</a> for a first look in the December issue.</p>
